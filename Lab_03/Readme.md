LAB Program:

Create a java program that performs the following operation:

-The program should collect an integer array from the user.
-After the array is entered, you need to create a menu of items.

1.Find the Mean Value
2.Find the Median Value
3.Find the Mode Value

From the user-given array.

The program should have a minimum of 3 functions apart from the main function; each of the functions implements the Mean, Median, and Mode computation by accepting the array user has entered as a parameter and returning the value as a result. From the main method, you will display the result.
